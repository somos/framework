/**
 * The kernel for the Somos framework.
 *
 * Using the kernel you can start the framework, add a series of actions and handle commands that can make use of these
 * actions.
 *
 * Example of a simple command line application:
 *
 *     \Somos\Somos::start()
 *         ->add(
 *             \Somos\Action::get(
 *                 new \Somos\Console\Command('greet:world')
 *             )->respondWith(function () { echo 'Hello World!'; }
 *         )
 *         ->handle(new \Somos\Console\Run());
 *
 * Let's look at the example above line-by-line:
 *
 * Line 1. The framework is started (configuration and modules can be added as parameters)
 * Line 2. We call the add method on the kernel to give it an action that _may_ be executed later.
 * Line 3. In the call method an object of class `\Somos\Action` is created and we pass it an instance of
 *         `\Somos\Console\Command`.
 * Line 4. With command we provide the name with which we can invoke this command from the command line ('hello:world').
 * Line 5. We tell the Action that as soon as it is done it will echo 'Hello World!' on screen.
 * Line 7. The kernel is instructed to execute the Message `\Somos\Console\Run`; which will check if the command line
 *         has been called with the 'hello:world' command and if so, it will execute the Action that we have provided
 *         earlier and respond with the given message ('Hello world').
 *
 * Here is a more complicated example where we accept an option called 'name' with which we can show the name of the
 * person to greet on screen:
 *
 *     \Somos\Somos::start()
 *         ->add(
 *             \Somos\Action::get(
 *                 new \Somos\Console\Command('greet:person', ['name' => ['Name to display']]),
 *                 function ($name) { return ['name' => $name]; }
 *             )->respondWith(function ($name) { echo "Hello $name!"; })
 *         )
 *         ->handle(new \Somos\Console\Run());
 *
 * The most noteworthy change has been in line 4 and 5; on line 4 we have added a definition on the command which
 * options are supported and what description they have (in this case it is just the option 'name').
 * On line 5 we have added a callback
